## 🔬 Research & Experience
- **Research Assistant – ETF Sanitizer (LLVM, C++)**  
  Supervised by Dr. Santosh Nagarakatte  
•	Building a vanilla C prototype inspired by Ozaki’s method implementing error-free transformations (EFT) for matrix mulitplication, validating exact error terms and cross-platform reproducibility.  
•	Researched and reproduced prior EFT techniques (e.g., Dekker, Veltkamp split, Ozaki) and experimented with alternative formulations to compare accuracy–throughput trade-offs under varying condition numbers.

- **Data Analyst Intern – NJ Dept. of Labor (SQL, Data Pipelines)**  
•	Wrote, optimized, and executed complex Oracle SQL scripts across ~200 large-scale public datasets, some even including millions of records, to support Employer Accounts Modernization and Workforce Modernization initiatives.  
•	Identified and resolved critical data discrepancies involving sensitive personal information (e.g., addresses, Social Security numbers), and developed automated data correction pipelines to ensure accuracy, integrity, and reproducibility across projects.  
•	Collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline workflows and enhance analytics, improving script performance by evaluating complex query logic and reducing runtimes by ~30%.  

- **Aresty Research Assistant – Flapping Wings (Python, MATLAB)**  
  Supervised by Dr. Mitsunori Denda   
•	Designed and implemented an advanced Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) to model unsteady insect flight dynamics, providing aerodynamic insights for next-generation Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) designs.  
•	Migrated complex simulation workflows from MATLAB to Python, integrating libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to improve simulation speed by 20% and enable high-resolution data visualization.  
•	Optimized simulation parameters (e.g., wing angle, flapping frequency, time-step size) and refined computational grids to enhance accuracy, stability, and efficiency in complex aerodynamic scenarios.

## 💻 Projects
- **Seizure Detection (Python, ML, Signal Processing)**  
--	Built a machine learning pipeline to detect epileptic seizures using EEG datasets (Bonn, CHB-MIT, Zenodo), integrating signal preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models.  
--	Applied advanced signal processing techniques (bandpass & notch filtering, Fourier and Wavelet transforms) to clean raw EEG data and extract time- and frequency-domain features.  
--	Trained and evaluated models (Neural Networks, Random Forests, Logistic Regression) achieving up to 96% average accuracy and 92% precision on prefiltered data, and robust performance (~88% accuracy) on raw EEG after preprocessing.  
--	Visualized feature importance and performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices), identifying Fourier-based features as most effective for seizure detection.

- **SmartExpense – Expense Management Platform (Java, Spring Boot, React, Docker)**  
--	Engineered a production-ready platform for secure expense tracking and management, fully containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose to achieve ~99.9% reproducible builds and deployment times reduced by 40%.  
--	Implemented enterprise-grade JWT authentication with password hashing and role-based access control, eliminating unauthorized access attempts during testing and significantly strengthening system security.  
--	Designed and optimized RESTful APIs with transactional consistency and Redis-backed caching, enabling real-time expense tracking with <100ms response latency and seamless scalability to 1,000+ concurrent requests.  

- **RAG-Powered Market Insight Assistant (Python, Streamlit, FAISS, OpenAI API)**  
--  Fetches up to 15 articles per query, cleans and chunks text (~500 chars), generates summaries via local BART or GPT-4o-mini.  
--	Embeds documents in 384-dim vectors with SentenceTransformers and FAISS, retrieving top K (3–10) snippets in milliseconds.  
--	Provides historical stock data and summaries (5d–1y) via yfinance, with interactive charts.  
--	Streamlit sidebar configuration, API key management, and offline mode enable real-time interactivity without paid APIs.  


- **Robust Chest X-Ray Disease Classification (Python, TensorFlow)**  
--	Developed a CNN for multi-label chest X-ray classification (14 thoracic diseases) using ChestMNIST.  
--	Implemented adversarial attacks (FGSM & PGD) to test robustness and improved resilience with adversarial training.  
--	Achieved AUC: 76% on clean data, 70% under FGSM, 63% under PGD, demonstrating model reliability and vulnerability analysis.  
--	Visualized adversarial examples to interpret model behavior and enhance explainability.

- **Mini OS Scheduler Simulator (C++, Python)**  
--	Designed and implemented a user-space threading library with custom schedulers (Round Robin, Priority, MLFQ) to simulate core OS scheduling concepts.  
--	Built a high-precision logging system and Python visualization tool to generate Gantt-chart timelines of thread execution and context switches.  
--	Demonstrated advanced systems concepts including cooperative context switching, blocking, preemption, and scheduler policy analysis across multiple test scenarios.
