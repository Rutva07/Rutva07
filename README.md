## 🔬 Research & Experience
- **Research Assistant – ETF Sanitizer (LLVM, C++)**  
  Supervised by Dr. Santosh Nagarakatte  
•	Design and implement an EFT sanitizer in C++ leveraging LLVM infrastructure, ensuring memory safety, control-flow correctness, and compliance with kernel execution constraints for user-submitted programs.  
•	Develop LLVM passes to analyze instruction sequences, enforce safety policies, and detect unsafe operations, focusing on reducing floating-point rounding errors by ~52% and improving numerical precision, while enhancing execution speed by ~20%.  
•	Simulate execution paths and enforce safety guarantees before kernel integration, improving program reliability and robustness while providing insights for extending sanitizer capabilities to advanced EFT features.


- **Data Analyst Intern – NJ Dept. of Labor (SQL, Data Pipelines)**  
•	Wrote, optimized, and executed complex Oracle SQL scripts across ~200 large-scale public datasets, some even including millions of records, to support Employer Accounts Modernization and Workforce Modernization initiatives.  
•	Identified and resolved critical data discrepancies involving sensitive personal information (e.g., addresses, Social Security numbers), and developed automated data correction pipelines to ensure accuracy, integrity, and reproducibility across projects.  
•	Collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline workflows and enhance analytics, improving script performance by evaluating complex query logic and reducing runtimes by ~30%.  

- **Aresty Research Assistant – Flapping Wings (Python, MATLAB)**  
  Supervised by Dr. Mitsunori Denda   
•	Designed and implemented an advanced Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) to model unsteady insect flight dynamics, providing aerodynamic insights for next-generation Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) designs.  
•	Migrated complex simulation workflows from MATLAB to Python, integrating libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to improve simulation speed by 20% and enable high-resolution data visualization.  
•	Optimized simulation parameters (e.g., wing angle, flapping frequency, time-step size) and refined computational grids to enhance accuracy, stability, and efficiency in complex aerodynamic scenarios.

## 💻 Selected Projects
- **Seizure Detection (Python, ML, Signal Processing)**  
--	Built a machine learning pipeline to detect epileptic seizures using EEG datasets (Bonn, CHB-MIT, Zenodo), integrating signal preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models.  
--	Applied advanced signal processing techniques (bandpass & notch filtering, Fourier and Wavelet transforms) to clean raw EEG data and extract time- and frequency-domain features.  
--	Trained and evaluated models (Neural Networks, Random Forests, Logistic Regression) achieving up to 96% average accuracy and 92% precision on prefiltered data, and robust performance (~88% accuracy) on raw EEG after preprocessing.  
--	Visualized feature importance and performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices), identifying Fourier-based features as most effective for seizure detection.
